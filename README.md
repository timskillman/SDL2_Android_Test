# SDL2_Android_Test
Very basic 3D cube in SDL2 on Android
=====================================

This project is an attempt at getting an SDL2 3D cuboid to render on Android.  

This is trivial on a PC but there seems to be limitations with the z-buffer on Android.

If anyone knows of a fix for this z-buffer issue, then you'll make me a happy developer!

This demo should load into Visual Studio 2015 and compile an APK for Android.


Go to main.cpp in the main folder
